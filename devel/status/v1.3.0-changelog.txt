FMRD-Desktop Version 1.3.0
==========================

Version 1.3.0 is the club team implementation of FMRD-Desktop.

There are two major changes in the application.  First, the FMRD now 
captures overview data that correspond to the three phases of football 
competitions: league, group, and knockout.  Second, a SQLite-compatible 
implementation of the FMRD has been added to the current PostgreSQL version.
