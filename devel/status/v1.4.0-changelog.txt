FMRD-Desktop Version 1.4.0
==========================

Version 1.4.0 is the national team implementation of FMRD-Desktop.

This version of the application merges features of Version 1.3.0
into Version 1.2.0.  The result is that as in the club implementation,
the FMRD now captures overview data that correspond to the three phases 
of football competitions: league, group, and knockout.  Second, a 
SQLite-compatible implementation of the FMRD has been added to the 
current PostgreSQL implementation.
