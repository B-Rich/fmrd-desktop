INSTALLATION
------------

FMRD-Desktop is run from either the command line or the standalone
application.

Build Requirements:
    - Python 2.6 (3.0 not supported)
    - Nokia Qt 4.6 toolkit
    - PyQt 4.6
    
Database Requirements:
    - Perl (DBI and Term packages)
    - PostgreSQL 8.x, OR
    - SQLite3 3.6.19+
    
(1) If you are using PostgreSQL, you should have access to an 
installed local Postgres server. If not, consult your system
administrator for assistance.

(2) Go to sql/ directory and enter the following command:
    
    > installdb-fmrd.sh db_name  (PostgreSQL)
    
    > installdb-fmrd-sqlite.sh db_name.db (SQLite)
    
    In the case of the SQLite script, you must have '*.db'
    as the filetype so that the file dialog can locate it.

    The database tables and views will be created.  If you are
    using PostgreSQL you will be challenged to enter your 
    username and password:
    
    -----------------------------------
    Enter username: user
    Enter password: ******
    Database authentication confirmed.
    -----------------------------------
    
    There are two other input fields:
    
    ------------------------------------------------------
    Enter maximum number of league or shootout rounds: ##
    [A]lpha or [N]umeric group names: #
    ------------------------------------------------------

    The validation tables will then be populated.

(3) Go to code/pyqt/ directory and run the data-entry application:

    > ./fmrd-main.pyw
    
    Alternatively, you can click on the executable icon for either 
    the Windows or Linux distributions.
