</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
The Football Match Result Database (FMRD) stores and maintains the match result data needed to support football (soccer) research activities for the benefit of the football analytics community. The current version of the database handles domestic league competitions. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Football Match Result Database does the following:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
Maintain data on matches that occur within football league competitions, whether among national teams or domestic clubs.
</li>
<li>
Maintain complete top-level information on the football match, including match date, competition name and stage, participating teams, venues, and environmental conditions.
</li>
<li>
Maintain complete information on macro-events that occur during a match, including goals, penalties, disciplinary incidents, and substitutions.
</li>
<li>
Maintain complete information on participating personnel, such as players, managers, and match referees.
</li>
</ul>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-2">2</a> System Requirements
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Requires:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
Python up to version 2.7 (3.0 not supported)
</li>
<li>
PostgreSQL (Any version in last 2-3 years should work, but 7.0+ preferred)
</li>
<li>
Perl (DBI package)
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
FMRD was originally coded on a 64-bit Linux operating system (Ubuntu Lucid Lynx), but was built using the Qt and PyQt libraries, so it should be able to function across Windows and Mac platforms. This has not been tested, however.
</div>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-3">3</a> Installation
</h1>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.1">3.1</a> Software download
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Check out FMRD from the Downloads section of the website located at 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<tt>http://www.fmrd-site.org/downloads/</tt>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Will add information about binary executable.
</div>
<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.2">3.2</a> Database setup
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Will have to work with system administrator to run a local Postgres server. Should be given a username and password for access.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Go to sql/ directory and run the <tt>installdb-fmrd</tt> shell script to create and set up FMRD:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<tt>&gt; cd sql/</tt>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<tt>&gt; installdb-fmrd.sh</tt>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The following information is required:
</div>
<ul>

<li>
Database name
</li>
<li>
User name
</li>
<li>
User password
</li>
<li>
Maximum number of rounds in league competition
</li>
</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
The script will create a database with tables and views from the FMRD template and populate the base tables. These tables support the main tables of the database and will be altered very seldom by the user. 
</div>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-4">4</a> Logging In
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
The user can populate the main tables of the FMRD with the data-entry application. To run the data-entry application, enter the following at the command prompt:
</div>
<div class="Indented">
<tt>&gt;./fmrd-main.py</tt>

The user will be challenged by the login dialog to enter the database name, username and password. There is also a pair of radio buttons along the top of the dialog to select between data-entry switchboards for users and administrators. 
</div>
<div class="Indented">
After the login information is entered, the user can authenticate by pressing the Ok button (keyboard shortcut Alt-O). If the user wishes to exit the program, press the Cancel button (Alt-C).

</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
The switchboard is the centerpiece of the data-entry application. It is composed of buttons that open dialog windows that allow the user to enter match information. There are two switchboards: a "user" switchboard with a basic menu bar that allows the user to quit the application and display About information, and an "administrator" switchboard that includes a Setup menu for access to the base tables. Database operations do not occur at the switchboard level.

The buttons open the data-entry dialogs and are grouped in three categories. The dialogs related to the high-level details of the match are grouped under "Match Overview", the dialogs related to the players, referees, and managers are in the "Personnel" section, and the dialogs pertaining to the football match are found under "Match Details".
</div>

The menus are organized accordingly with keyboard shortcuts in parentheses:

<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-6">6</a> Getting Started with Data Entry
</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
This section describes the data entry dialogs on the application. For each dialog there is a read-only field for the ID number of the current record and fields that populate the underlying database table by entering data or selecting from a data list. Unless stated otherwise, the fields cannot be left blank or unselected.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
It is important to remember that the database builds on itself. The data entry application is designed so that the user cannot enter match information before entering information about the players involved, to give one example. The match overview and personnel tables must be populated with a minimum number of records before the match detail dialogs are enabled.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
All of the dialogs, with the exception of the Environmental Conditions dialog, have navigation buttons that allow the user to access records in sequential order, as well as skip to either the first or last record. There are three other buttons in the dialogs: 
</div>
<ul>

<li>
an "<b>Add</b>" (Alt-A) button that allows the user to append a new record to the end of the underlying table, 
</li>
<li>
a "<b>Delete</b>" (Alt-D) button that erases the current record (subject to permission by the database), and 
</li>
<li>
a "<b>Close</b>" (Alt-C) button that saves the current record to the database and closes the dialog.
</li>
</ul>

<div class="Unindented">
The Competitions dialog allows entry of the names of the league competitions. All matches are tied to a specific league competition, so the Competitions table in the FMRD must be populated with at least one entry. There is only one field that can be accessed by the user, which is the Competition field. The field cannot be left blank.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
If data from multiple league seasons are to be contained in a single database, it is recommended that the user differentiate the competition names, such as "2009-10 English Premier League" and "2010-11 English Premier League".

Users typically enter the official name of the team or its popular name. Of course, the entry is at the discretion of the user, but it should be distinctive from other names in the database.

The Players dialog allows for entry of player data. One thing that might be surprising to users who use other sports databases is that the team associated with the player is not entered here; rather, the association is handled via the match lineups. Thus the Players table is easier to maintain over time.
