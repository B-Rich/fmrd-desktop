\begin_layout Title
FMRD: Desktop-Based Data Entry Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Howard Hamilton
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Football Match Result Database (FMRD) stores and maintains the match
 result data needed to support football (soccer) research activities for
 the benefit of the football analytics community.
 The current version of the database handles domestic league competitions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Football Match Result Database does the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maintain data on matches that occur within football league competitions,
 whether among national teams or domestic clubs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maintain complete top-level information on the football match, including
 match date, competition name and stage, participating teams, venues, and
 environmental conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maintain complete information on macro-events that occur during a match,
 including goals, penalties, disciplinary incidents, and substitutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maintain complete information on participating personnel, such as players,
 managers, and match referees.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
System Requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Requires:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Python up to version 2.7 (3.0 not supported)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PostgreSQL (Any version in last 2-3 years should work, but 7.0+ preferred)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Perl (DBI package)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
FMRD was originally coded on a 64-bit Linux operating system (Ubuntu Lucid
 Lynx), but was built using the Qt and PyQt libraries, so it should be able
 to function across Windows and Mac platforms.
 This has not been tested, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Installation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Software download
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Check out FMRD from the Downloads section of the website located at 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
http://www.fmrd-site.org/downloads/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Will add information about binary executable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Database setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Will have to work with system administrator to run a local Postgres server.
 Should be given a username and password for access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
Go to sql/ directory and run the 
\family typewriter
installdb-fmrd
\family default
 shell script to create and set up FMRD:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
> cd sql/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
> installdb-fmrd.sh
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The following information is required:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Database name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
User password
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maximum number of rounds in league competition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The script will create a database with tables and views from the FMRD template
 and populate the base tables.
 These tables support the main tables of the database and will be altered
 very seldom by the user.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Logging In
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user can populate the main tables of the FMRD with the data-entry applicatio
n.
 To run the data-entry application, enter the following at the command prompt:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The user will be challenged by the login dialog to enter the database name,
 username and password.
 There is also a pair of radio buttons along the top of the dialog to select
 between data-entry switchboards for users and administrators.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the login information is entered, the user can authenticate by pressing
 the Ok button (keyboard shortcut Alt-O).
 If the user wishes to exit the program, press the Cancel button (Alt-C).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application will close on three consecutive failed attempts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The Data Entry Switchboards
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The switchboard is the centerpiece of the data-entry application.
 It is composed of buttons that open dialog windows that allow the user
 to enter match information.
 There are two switchboards: a "user" switchboard with a basic menu bar
 that allows the user to quit the application and display About information,
 and an "administrator" switchboard that includes a Setup menu for access
 to the base tables.
 Database operations do not occur at the switchboard level.

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The buttons open the data-entry dialogs and are grouped in three categories.
 The dialogs related to the high-level details of the match are grouped
 under "Match Overview", the dialogs related to the players, referees, and
 managers are in the "Personnel" section, and the dialogs pertaining to
 the football match are found under "Match Details".
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The menus are organized accordingly with keyboard shortcuts in parentheses:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Getting Started with Data Entry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes the data entry dialogs on the application.
 For each dialog there is a read-only field for the ID number of the current
 record and fields that populate the underlying database table by entering
 data or selecting from a data list.
 Unless stated otherwise, the fields cannot be left blank or unselected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to remember that the database builds on itself.
 The data entry application is designed so that the user cannot enter match
 information before entering information about the players involved, to
 give one example.
 The match overview and personnel tables must be populated with a minimum
 number of records before the match detail dialogs are enabled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the dialogs, with the exception of the Environmental Conditions dialog,
 have navigation buttons that allow the user to access records in sequential
 order, as well as skip to either the first or last record.
 There are three other buttons in the dialogs: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
an "
\series bold
Add
\series default
" (Alt-A) button that allows the user to append a new record to the end
 of the underlying table, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a "
\series bold
Delete
\series default
" (Alt-D) button that erases the current record (subject to permission by
 the database), and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a "
\series bold
Close
\series default
" (Alt-C) button that saves the current record to the database and closes
 the dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Pre-Competition Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Competitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Competitions dialog allows entry of the names of the league competitions.
 All matches are tied to a specific league competition, so the Competitions
 table in the FMRD must be populated with at least one entry.
 There is only one field that can be accessed by the user, which is the
 Competition field.
 The field cannot be left blank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If data from multiple league seasons are to be contained in a single database,
 it is recommended that the user differentiate the competition names, such
 as "2009-10 English Premier League" and "2010-11 English Premier League".

\begin_layout Standard
The Teams dialog allows entry of the team name.
 Match venues can be associated with a home team, while matches, match lineups,
 and match events must be associated with teams.
 There is only one field that can be accessed by the user, which is the
 Teams field.
 This field cannot be left blank.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Users typically enter the official name of the team or its popular name.
 Of course, the entry is at the discretion of the user, but it should be
 distinctive from other names in the database.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Players
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Players dialog allows for entry of player data.
 One thing that might be surprising to users who use other sports databases
 is that the team associated with the player is not entered here; rather,
 the association is handled via the match lineups.
 Thus the Players table is easier to maintain over time.
